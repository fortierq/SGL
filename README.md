# SGL
SGL (Simple Graph Library) is a C++ library allowing manipulation of graphs, in a generic way. SGL includes the following:

graph traversals (DFS, BFS)

shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford)

minimum-weight spanning tree (Prim, Kruskal)

Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flow

and much more!
